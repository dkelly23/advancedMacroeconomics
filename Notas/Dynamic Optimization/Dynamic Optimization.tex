\section{Utility Maximization in Discrete Time}

An individual aims to maximize the \textit{present discounted value} of her lifetime utility $U_t$, which is a function of her consumption on every period:
\eq{U_t=u(c_0)+\beta u(c_1) + \beta^2 u(c_2)+(...)=\dsum{t=0}{\infty}\beta^t u(c_t)}

This characterization depends on the assumption that the utility of the consumer is intertemporaly additive, that is, the utility the consumer gets by her consumption on each period enters her lifetime utility added to her previous utility, discounted by a discount factor $\beta$.\\

\subsection{Discount Factor}

Part of the preferences of the consumer are represented partially by a parameter $\beta \in (0,1)$, which measures the level of impatience to consume, this is, the degree to which the consumer discounts the utility of future consumption.
